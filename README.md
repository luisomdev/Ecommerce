# Ecommerce
It is a vertical cut, this project was previously built for the year 2022. This is a final rebuild of the project using improved and updated techniques, this project was mainly focused to be a CRM but after 2 weeks of the client decided for a Web ecommerce with CMS and CRM. The project was delivered however due to unknown issues I have not found the web, but I had documents that guided me as was the idea of the project in general, this is a rebuild and to avoid any conflict I have changed the design and certain functions to avoid copying the project. The reconstruction of the project is more to close the chapter of a project that did not end up receiving all its updates due to lack of funds.

**The expected updates of this project will be as follows.** 
  - The overall project documentation will be updated.
  - CRM functions will be updated for social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok). A more abstract form will be added to work with other Resful APIS from other social networks. These functions are used for posting, reading comments and advertising, this section is called **“Social Media”**.
  - The UI will be updated to make it simpler.
  - Dark mode and light mode will be implemented.
  - WCAG standard will be implemented.
